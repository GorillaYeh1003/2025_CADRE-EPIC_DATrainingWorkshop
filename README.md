# DA-training-2024
The tutorial for the PFF is provided in the format of Jupyter notebook. There are three ways to run these notebooks interactively:
- From the web-based [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GorillaYeh1003/2025_CADRE-EPIC_DATrainingWorkshop/HEAD),
- From [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GorillaYeh1003/2025_CADRE-EPIC_DATrainingWorkshop/blob/main/DAworkshop_PFF.ipynb)
- Run it on your local machine with downloaded contents (requiring numpy and matplotlib modules).
